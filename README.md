# Speech-Transcription-Verification

## Objective
Develop an efficient Speech Transcription Validation System for Indian languages, incorporating automated audio segmentation, precise transcription generation, and a user-friendly interface with advanced features, including user authentication, transcription review, navigation, editing, synchronized audio playback, virtual keyboard support, and local storage. 

## Brief description 
Our project focuses on creating an efficient Speech Transcription Verification System tailored for Indian languages. It accomplishes this by segmenting large audio files, converting segments into text using a speech-to-text API, and presenting them to users for review and correction.
- This system features a user-friendly interface with advanced functionalities such as user authentication, enabling secure access and usage.
- Users can efficiently navigate through transcripts, ensuring seamless review and editing.
- Additionally, our system supports Indian languages by offering a virtual keyboard, enhancing accessibility and accuracy.
- Users have the option to save or discard each transcription, and the system ensures that audio segments are reviewed only once, optimizing the verification process.
Our projectâ€™s ultimate goal is to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of speech transcriptions while making the process user-friendly and accessible for transcribers.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following software installed on your local machine:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (only if you want to run the application locally without Docker)

### Running the Application with Docker

These instructions will help you run the application using Docker. If you prefer to run it locally, please skip to the "Local Development" section.

- Clone this directory and move to its root using `cd Speech-Transcription-Verification/`
- Build the Docker images for the frontend and backend by running `docker-compose build`
- After the images are successfully built, you can run the application using `docker-compose up`
- Docker Compose will start the frontend and backend containers, and the application will be accessible at the following URL: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- To stop the application and shut down the containers, press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal where Docker Compose is running.

Note - Running Docker with `sudo` can be necessary if your user doesn't have the necessary permissions to interact with Docker.

### Local Development 

If you want to run the application locally without Docker for development purposes:

- Clone this directory and move to its root using `cd Speech-Transcription-Verification/`
- Run `npm install` to install all the dependencies. 
- Run `node server.js` to start the server.
- Open a new tab in your terminal and run `cd frontend/speech-transcription-app/`
- Then run `npm start` to run the app in the development mode.
- Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Tech Stack
- Programming Languages: Python for backend development, JavaScript for fron-
tend.
- Front-end: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the user interface, enhanced by React
for dynamic content rendering.
- Back-end: Python for audio splitting and generating transcripts, Node.js for server-
side logic and API development.
- Caching and Data Storage: LocalStorage API is employed for client-side caching
to store transient data, ensuring data continuity.
- Version Control: Git was used for version control and collaborative development.
- Docker: Docker was employed to containerize the web application for efficient
deployment.
- Other Libraries and Frameworks: Axios and Fetch API for save/discard, Pydub
and WebRTC Voice Activity Detection (VAD) for audio chunking, react-router-dom
for client-side routing and navigation, react-simple-keyboard for Telugu keyboard
